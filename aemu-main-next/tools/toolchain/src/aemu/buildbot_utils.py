    A temporary directory manager that conditionally skips cleanup
    if the BUILD_CONTEXT environment variable is set. This is mainly
    to make sure we do not get into issues with Windows where files
    might be locked due to bazel, or meson.

    If BUILD_CONTEXT is set:
    - And `dir` constructor argument is None, it will prioritize using the
      directory specified by the TMPDIR environment variable. If TMPDIR is
      not set, a warning is issued, and standard temp directory selection proceeds.
    - The created directory is NOT removed when the context is exited or when the
      object is garbage collected.

    If BUILD_CONTEXT is NOT set:
    - Behaves like tempfile.TemporaryDirectory, creating the directory
      (respecting TMPDIR, TEMP, etc., if `dir` is None) and cleaning it up.
